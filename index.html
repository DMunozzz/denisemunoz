<p>My favorite drink is water, because it is the healthiest and most affordable drink that I can consume.
    Water is said to be the "source of life" because it is vital in most living organisms on earth.
    Water is neccessary for many biological processes including hydration and chemical transport of nutrients and waste throughtout organisms.
    Also, because water is a very abundant naturally occuring liquid it is way cheaper to purchase than a heavily processed sugary drink. So, for now I will stick to drinking 
    water and occasionally have some flavored sparkiling water as a treat on special occasions lol.</p>
